# My Music App

This is an app to search spotify albums.  <br/>
This page consumes the Spotify API to display album information.
It is made with React, Redux and some style libraries



## `Views`

There is a landingpage where you can log in, there is a section where you can search for albums uploaded to spotify. <br/>
There is also a view that allows you to view the favorite albums of your spotify account

### `Figma`

Use figma to mockup views for both desktop and mobile.  <br/> 
Below I will add the mockups:
<div>
<img height="250" width="250"  src="./readmeImages/Landing.png"/>
<img  height="250" width="250" src="./readmeImages/Albums.png"/>
<img height="250" width="250" src="./readmeImages/Favorites.png"/>
<img height="250" width="250" src="./readmeImages/LandingMobile.png"/>
<img height="250" width="250" src="./readmeImages/AlbumsMobile.png"/>
<img height="250" width="250" src="./readmeImages/landingMobile.png"/>
</div>
